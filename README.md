This CMS was created for the 3D Printing Club at the University of Missouri.
Project started January 2011 and finished August of 2012

The system has an RSVP system, user accounts, as well as badge monitoring and management (depending on if the user earned the badge or not).

This CMS was one of my first large-scale coding projects and my introduction to programming.
